# CS140_Final_Project

The purpose of the project is to create a simulator for a simple computer with a small number of instructions. It was originally inspired by a project called Pippin--from pp.210-214 of "The Analytical Engine, An Introduction to Computer Science Using the Internet" by Rick Decker and Stuart Hirshfield (B Publishing Company, 1998). However, many extensions have been made.
